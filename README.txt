This project (San Andreas multi-player user control panel) was created by Ellis, I made a design and coded it,
I also added new function such as VIP levels, text payments, upgraded admin control panel, news for players,
house tokens, some minor bug fixes and some other changes. Its there on my computer since 2013, feel free to use it for
yourself, if you need any help to set up the server or configure it for yourself, contact me and I'll be
more than welcome to help you. The icons and emoji is copyright free.
